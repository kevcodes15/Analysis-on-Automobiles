# Analysis-on-Automobiles
This is a data analysis of a csv dataset of automobiles producing meaningful outputs

This project uses Python programming language and Jupyter notebooks to perform data analysis on the dataset, and shares the insights. The analysis includes exploring the distribution of vehicles by make, identifying the most common fuel types used, and examining the relationship between vehicle weight and fuel efficiency.

Visualizations are also used to help illustrate findings, including histograms and scatterplots. Overall, the article showcases the potential of data analysis to reveal fascinating patterns and insights about the automobiles we use every day.

The packages used to deal with the data preparation & cleaning are pandas, and for the visualization of data are matplotlib and seaborn.
